> Bits are organised and represented as 0's or 1's. In this case, creating numbers in binary operates by using powers of 2, each digit from right to left increases the "underlying value we seek in legitimate humanly understood numbers" by a factor of two.

#### An example of the number 431 in binary:

> 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
>  0  |  1  |  1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

## Day 1 - Monday 5th Nov

>Going through some node stuff today, first day of learning MEAN stack. Have installed new docsets for various JS languages.

###https://nodejs.org/en/
> Node.js home page

###https://github.com/creationix/nvm
> Install NVM according to instructions, from here, install node via NVM install node

###https://trello.com/b/BVujtxWF/term-3-javascript-node-mongodb-react
> Trello board of JS challenges for completion in the afternoon.

###https://www.developphp.com/video/JavaScript/Digital-Clock-Tutorial-Custom-Animated-Clock
> Tutorial used to complete the digital clock challenge
> GH Link: https://github.com/JohnVonNeumann/digital-clock_js.git

###https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
> Free online book with challenges similar to that of LRTHW or Michael Hartl's Rails stuff, working through some of the challenges.


## Day 2 - Tuesday 6th Nov

>Today our lecture is on Callback Functions.

### Reading through EJS - http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html

> Bits are organised and represented as 0's or 1's. In this case, creating numbers in binary operates by using powers of 2, each digit from right to left increases the "underlying value we seek in legitimate humanly understood numbers" by a factor of two.

#### An example of the number 431 in binary:

> 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
>  0  |  1  |  1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
__________________________________________________
> 431 = 0110101111

> Using, JavaScript can display number values upto 18 quintillion, which is an 18 with 18 zeroes after it, JS performs this numerical representation by restricting its binary digit string length to 64 bits.
#### Basic value types in js:
* numbers
* strings
* booleans
* objects
* functions   
* undefined values


## Day 3 - Wednesday 7th Nov

> Setting up Node.js files, using 'npm init' and fill out the relevant info using enter and inputting info, at the end, it will output a json fle called package.json.

> We then run 'npm install node-fetch --save' to add a fetch package to our dir, this adds a folder called 'node_modules' to our file tree in atom, thhe 'npm WARN xxxxxxxxx No repository field' comment is apparently normal.

### JQuery
>Old, around a decade old.
>jQuery wraps common DOM and JS tasks to be more friendly.
>jQuery is JS.
>It is not a framework, it is a library.
>jQuery is NOT vanilla JS.
>jQuery is being phased out due to younger frameworks doing it's job in less code.

### API - Application Programming Interface
>Allows us to write code that generates an interface to interact with.
